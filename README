INFINIMINER FOR XNA 4.0
=======================

The plan is to eventually have a stable version of the game to put on
FNA, as well as a generally more supported XNA version.

Because I can, I am absolutely keeping the XNA version, but the FNA
version will (if I don't forget about the project) be available for
cross-platform play, as well as (sarcasm ahead) raytracing, super-
duper-ultra graphics, megachrist ambient occlusion, and PBR shaders.


BUILDING
========

Building Infiniminer requires Visual Studio 2010 and XNA Game Studio 4.0. 

You'll also need the fonts 04b03b and 04b08 from the following site:

Simply build the solution and you should be good to go.


KNOWN ISSUES
============
Polygons in BlockEngine tend to explore the outer reaches of the universe
and other blocks.

Player models are busted.

Networking is greatly untested and is also probably busted.
