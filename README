INFINIMINER FOR XNA 4.0
=======================

The plan is to eventually have a stable version of the game to put on
FNA, as well as a generally more supported XNA version.

Because I can, I am absolutely keeping the XNA version, but the FNA
version will (if I don't forget about the project) be available for
cross-platform play, as well as (sarcasm ahead) raytracing, super-
duper-ultra graphics, megachrist ambient occlusion, and PBR shaders.

This version is based off of the master branch of the craftworkgames 
fork of Infiniminer.
I have no idea what some of the stuff is, like why it has sprint.
If anyone complains about it, I'll look into making options or 
removing stuff.

BUILDING
========

XNA
Building Infiniminer requires Visual Studio 2010 and XNA Game Studio 4.0. 

This outputs a working game build to the bin folder at the root of the 
file structure. Refer to the buildstuff folder.

You'll also need the fonts 04b03b and 04b08 from the following site:

http://www.dsg4.com/04/extra/bitmap/

Simply build the solution and you should be good to go.

FNA
Alternatively, if you use the FNA version you can use a minimum of
Visual Studio 2010 and probably any newer version. 

Just open the InfiniminerFNA.sln in your version of choice, convert it
if it asks, and build. <--- UNTESTED

This outputs a working game build to the bin-fna folder at the root of the 
file structure. Refer to the buildstuff folder.

If you do this however, you need built content from the XNA version to 
put into a Content folder where the game build is. 

You also must follow the FNA wiki on how to build a game, and use the
libs from the buildstuff folder; https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/wiki


KNOWN ISSUES
============

No major ones, but networking might still be busted. Has been tested
