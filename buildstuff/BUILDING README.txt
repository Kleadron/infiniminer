THIS FILE DOES NOT GO WITH THE GAME.

These are some files that were in the bin folder before I added it to the gitignore.
Preferably, you would distribute most of them with the game, when creating the installer.

song_title.ogg is to go in the content folder for the FNA version, basically replacing the wma file.
This is because FNA cannot load WMA files.

fnalibs contains all of the natives and stuff used in the current version of the game.
